A Glimpse of Vagabond – Interactive Experience
 This is a interactive manga piece which animate certain panels to increase the immersion and feel of the manga 


 aim or initial objective:
 To create an narrativce interactive animated experience of the manga Vagabond



concept and inspiration:
 Initially, I planned to animate a funny real-life incident. However, during the storyboarding stage, I realized that drawing and animating every frame would demand significant effort in illustration, leaving less time to focus on the coding aspect.
 to focus more on the coding aspect , i decided to animate a manga panel instead. i specifically chose Vagabond because it is one of my favourite manga series and it has never been officially animated. i was inpired by the manga panel animation edits often seen on youtube which were mostly created using CapCut. my though was to recreat that in p5.js.



process:
 i selected a particular scene from Vagabond because it conveyed both tension and action, i began by cutting out specific elements from the panles such as hands, head, etc which were then placed on top of the base layer 

 initially, i controlled interavtivity using a single if statement followed by and else if condition, however this way i could only animate two panel

 to resolve this, i tried using seperate if statement for each animated element, as adviced by a friend, resolved this problem and allowed me to aniate multiple panels

 then came a part where rotation upon its axis was needed but rotate function altered its origin point, but with my teacher guidance i solved this issue by inserting a alternate rotated image of the same part when clicked 

 i added a background music and sounds effects to each moving part to enhance immersion, each interacrive part was paired with an appropriate sound cue to enrich the experience and give a cinematic feels

 but during the presentation there was a confusion regarding the proper sequence  to read thee manga which kind of destroyed th immersive experience 
 to addres this problem , i tried to overlay a blurred image with numbering to guide the user, however the code was not working and it broke the whole animation
 after several attempts to fix the overlays , i simply chose to add the reading order number directly onto the base images by addind text on it
 this ensured user could now see clealy the correct order



final outcome:
 the outcome was an interactive piece which had animations but not too complex but it has immersion created by th music and the sudden cuts 

what i wish to do in the future:
 i wil try to make the animations more complex and smooth by having lever like overlaying parts which creates a more natural animations
 i wioul also like to work on a blurred overlaying panels with numbers  which can dissappear when clicked to show the real imagee and all other (next) images would also be blurred
