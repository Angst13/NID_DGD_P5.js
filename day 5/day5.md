we started using sprites, first to animate a simple animation sprite using spritesheet and learned to assign iit to a key, after that moved onto a more complex sprite animation
assignment1: to  replace  just the sprite sheet and make a 2d animated sprite
Objective: to make a 2d sprite animation
process: i started by taking a free sprite from the internet
          but it had each image for all the four direction of its walking animations, as opposed to the code we were given where it was all in one image , so i had to combine all the four images into a single spritesheet, first few attempts did not work out as the the distance between each sprite were nt equal, after some tinkiering with the size and grid the sprite animation startes=d working

assignment2 :to make another image generative art
objective: to make genart which does not seem boxy
process : again i tried to make a patter connected to each 
          other of all for sides, but the result were less satifactory but definetely an improvement on the previous work

assignment 3: to make a 30 second interactive work with all the knowledge up till now
objective: to try to animate a panel of manga chapter \
what i want to do: i want to complete interactive panel which play sound when i click on the panel,
process: first i tried to make the animate as if the panels
         appeared page by page but it got a little too complex, i stuck to one page sonatining all the images, i cut out the parts i want to create the layers  but i forgot to save the layers as images and had to redo the layers,
         after the cutting and adding the layer inthe sktech.js and preloading the images i tried to moved the x and y coordinate of the overlays to move them up and down for the first two panels
