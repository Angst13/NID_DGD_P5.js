The objective of this assignment was to create a flower that can sway naturally and grow over time using p5.js. The task focused on applying object-oriented programming concepts, specifically by using a class object to define the flower’s properties and behaviors.



Concept and Implementation:
for this assignment , i made a flower which generates flowers with randoms sizes, colors and petal counts 
to simulate swaying motion, i used perlins noise function(noise()) to create smooth natural side to side movement, growth effect was achieved by gradually increasing the flower size variable over time 


final outcome
the final animation displays mutliple flowers growing and swaying naturally, each in unique size, color and pental count
