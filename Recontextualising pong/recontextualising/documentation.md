Murphy’s Pong

The “ism” chosen is Pejorism

Pejorism is the belief that the world is becoming worse, that things are in decline rather than improving. It is closely related to pessimism, but while pessimism focuses on the suffering or meaninglessness of individual life, pejorism refers more to the overall direction of society or the world as a whole. However, it differs slightly from pessimism — pessimism says that life is suffering or meaningless, whereas pejorism believes that things used to be better and are now getting worse.


Personal interpretation of pejorism
My personal interpretation of this “ism” is that there are no positive things waiting to happen in the world. The same can be said about every life lived on this seemingly hopeless planet, where the good don’t get their dues and are constantly taken advantage of. The situation keeps getting worse and worse, and all one can really do is hold on and manage with what little they have left.
I named this game “Murphy’s Pong,” as it aligns with Murphy’s Law, which states that “everything that can go wrong, will go wrong.” This idea perfectly captures the essence of pejorism



Recontextualizing Pong with rules based on Pejorism
The game begins as a normal, functioning version of Pong, but as time progresses, it starts to deteriorate and become increasingly unplayable.
Changes in the Modified Pong Rules:
• The paddles start to get smaller.
• The paddles get stuck randomly.
• The ball suddenly splits into multiple balls.
• The ball’s speed increases unexpectedly.



Explanation of How These Rules Embody Pejorism: In the beginning, the game is stable and enjoyable, representing a well-functioning world. As time passes, random disruptions start to occur, making the game more chaotic and difficult to control. These gradual and unpredictable changes reflect the core idea of pejorism — that everything which starts well will eventually decline and fall apart. The shrinking paddles and uncontrollable mechanics symbolize the loss of stability and fairness, while the game’s final collapse — when the paddles completely disappear — represents the ultimate decay of the system. Through this progressive breakdown, Murphy’s Pong captures the pejorist view that no matter how good things may seem at first, everything inevitably worsens with time.
