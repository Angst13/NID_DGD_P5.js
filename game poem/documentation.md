**# WHEN I CAME BACK TO WHERE WE USED TO BE**


Game Poem 

This game poem is partly inspired by a personal experience during my Diwali vacation. I was excited to return home and reconnect with my friends, to relive old memories and familiar places. But when I got there, something felt different. The people, the spaces, and even the conversations no longer felt the same.

I realized that while I had been away, life had continued for them, they had grown together, and I had changed in my own way elsewhere. That subtle distance, that quiet disconnection, made me feel like I was the only one missing something and everybody else felt it was all the same

Through this game poem, I wanted to recreate that feeling  of returning to something familiar yet changed, and of finding the courage to move forward despite that sense of loss. The narrative is intentionally left open to interpretation, allowing players to project their own emotions and memories onto it.


On the technical side, I began with the foundational concepts we learned in class and took some pointers from the works of my classmates. I created my own sprites and used AI assistance to handle some of the more complex coding elements.

At first, the project felt a bit bland — not in visuals or mechanics, but in emotion. I couldn’t quite feel the mood I wanted to convey. But as I continued refining it, the coding gradually became more complex, and in that process of trial and error, the emotion began to surface. The technical challenges themselves became part of the creative journey — each adjustment, each bug fixed, seemed to echo the theme of returning, rebuilding, and moving forward.

At first, the project felt a bit bland, not in its visuals or mechanics, but in emotion. I couldn’t quite capture the mood I wanted to convey. But as I continued refining it, the coding gradually became more complex, and through that process of trial and error, the emotion began to surface. Overall, I feel there’s still room for improvement, especially in refining the animations and assets
